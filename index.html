      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi there, I am Katia, a full-stack web Developer with a bachelor's
        degree in computer science. Passionate about new technologies and
        software development as well as artificial intelligence. Web development
        hasn't always been my goal, but once I started studying for my degree it
        was hard to keep me away from my computer. When I am not coding, I am
        working out, reading or spending time with loved ones.

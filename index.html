      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi there, I am Katia, a full-stack web Developer with a bachelor's
        degree in computer science. Passionate about new technologies and

        hasn't always been my goal, but once I started studying for my degree it

        working out, reading or spending time with loved ones.
